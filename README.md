I'm a developer with a vision: to make career-focused education accessible, structured, and free. I'm currently working on a CRUD app that bridges the gap between YouTube and traditional degrees — aiming to offer full career paths through curated video content.

## Projects I'm Building

### CareerTube *(WIP)*
A platform for structured, career-based education. Think "YouTube meets curriculum" — organize video lessons, track progress, and help users reach industry-level skills.

- CRUD functionality for courses, lessons, and users
- Progress tracking
- Embed videos (YouTube, Vimeo, or self-hosted)
- Goal: Mimic the structure of a real degree, not random playlists

> “Education shouldn’t be a maze of distractions — it should be a path.”
